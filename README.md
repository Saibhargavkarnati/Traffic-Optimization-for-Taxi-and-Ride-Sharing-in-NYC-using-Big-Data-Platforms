# ðŸš• Traffic Optimization for Taxi and Ride-Sharing in NYC using Big Data Platforms

This project aims to optimize traffic flow and improve ride-sharing efficiency in New York City by leveraging big data platforms. By analyzing traffic volume and ride-sharing data using scalable tools like Apache Spark and AWS S3, we built a predictive model that helps forecast congestion and suggests actionable insights for city planners and transportation platforms.

---

## Project Objectives

- Identify traffic congestion patterns by time and location
- Predict vehicle volume across NYC road segments
- Provide data-driven recommendations for taxi dispatch and route planning
- Visualize trends and volatility in traffic across different segments and times of day

---

## Data Sources

- [NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data (Parquet)](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
- [NYC Traffic Volume Counts (CSV)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/)
- Location Zone Lookup Table

All data was stored and accessed via **AWS S3 Buckets** for scalability and cloud-based processing.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- Top 10 congested segments identified by time of day
- Peak yellow cab demand around **5â€“7 PM** in Midtown
- High variability in traffic volume for some segments
- GBT model achieved **RÂ² = 0.90**, indicating strong prediction accuracy

---

## Recommendations

- Optimize real-time driver distribution based on predicted congestion
- Avoid dispatching drivers to highly congested areas during peak hours
- Integrate predictive routing into ride-hailing platforms

---

## Visual Outputs

- Traffic Volume Trend (24 hours)
- Volatility by Road Segment
- Actual vs Predicted Traffic Scatter Plot
- Congestion Ranking Visualizations

---

## Future Opportunities

- Incorporate weather, event, and social data
- Integrate real-time streaming using Kafka and Spark Streaming
- Use Edge AI and Federated Learning for privacy-focused, real-time predictions
